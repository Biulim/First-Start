<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<P>You can easily embed and use the WebUI library in your project using your preferred programming languages, which gives you straightforward and easy-to-use APIs to create UI using web technologies.

Think of WebUI like a WebView controller, but instead of embedding the WebView controller in your program, which makes it big, and non-portable as it needs the WebView runtimes. Instead, using WebUI, you use a tiny static/dynamic library to run any installed web browser and use it as GUI, making your program small, fast and portable. All it needs is a web browser.
